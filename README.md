# HandsOn-SEA

HandsOn-SEA is a single degree of freedom educational robot that features series elastic actuation and relies on closed loop force control to achieve the desired level of safety and transparency during physical interactions. HandsOn-SEA complements the existing impedance-type Haptic Paddle designs by demonstrating the challenges involved in the synergistic design and control of admittance-type devices. HandsOn-SEA can be used to allow students to experience the performance trade-offs inherent in force control systems, due to the non-collocation between the force sensor and the actuator.
